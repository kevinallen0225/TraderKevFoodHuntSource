A small project I took on to create a side scrolling Unity game, I will not be releasing it as I was just developing it to create a better understanding of the engine. 
I developed the scripts using C# and gathered the sprites and animations from the Unity Asset store.
I developed this game to display on a small scale how to gamify an everyday positive behavior like eating healthy with the ability to let the character choose what they collect.
